A-list celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez and LeBron James, entrepreneurs, hedge-fund investors, heiresses, and studio executives own homes in the quiet cul-de-sac. That was until squatters invaded in October and locals started complaining about them allegedly throwing "wild parties" with "cocaine and orgies." The neighbors are getting fed up, including reportedly James, according to a report in New York Magazine's Curbed.   ARMY RESERVIST REACTS TO COURT FINALLY GIVING SQUATTER THE BOOT: 'SHE DEFINITELY KNEW THE SYSTEM'  Ben Affleck Jennifer Lopez LeBron James   "One of the neighbors got in touch with LeBron James’s house manager. They were told James was very concerned," the report said.   A tech entrepreneur, Rick Rankin, who lived nearby said, "I wasn’t born yesterday. They’re jittery; their eyes are spinning. They were clearly on something." The report referenced an unnamed "producer" who questioned, "Who the f--- are these people squatting in the most exclusive Zip Code in America?"

Woodward IV, was notified by one of the pool workers that a U-haul truck had pulled up. The agent immediately went to the property. He found that the locks had been changed and the FOR SALE sign was gone. Police then informed Woodward that their hands were tied because it was a "civil matter" since squatters produced what they claimed was a rental agreement.     According to the report, the locals are fired up – complaining every single day among themselves about the squatters and haranguing the association to do something about it.   Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James gestures to a referee during the first half in Game 3 of an NBA basketball Western Conference semifinal against the Golden State Warriors Saturday, May 6, 2023, in Los Angeles.  (AP Photo/Mark J.

"These squatters have been here since October, charging rents for rooms and throwing massive parties all night long," the real estate agent previously said. "I just want to get this house sold to satisfy the court."   Hannah Grossman is a Reporter at Fox News Digital.
